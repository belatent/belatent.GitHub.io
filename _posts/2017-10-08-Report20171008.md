[Example for the above video](https://github.com/mrm1001/spark_tutorial/blob/master/spark_tutorial.py)

### Seperate the algorithm in to Steps
Furthermore,  I made a plan to seperate the algorithm into several parts, in the first part, I will try to add featrues in to the Apriori to make it fit an another sign to judge the priority.
Currently I am fixing the bug of this feature.

### Next
I need to prepare the IEEExreme and ACM. I will pause the project at next week.

##Update in 10/16
I attended the IEEEXtreme 11.0 compitition as team DBSDXQ and get 638.38 points, we got the rank 382 in the world, rank 14 in Canada and rank 1 in the U of M.
