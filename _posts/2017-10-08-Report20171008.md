In this week, I did:

### Learn Spark
I followed the instructions below to learn the basic operations of spark.

[Example for the above video](https://github.com/mrm1001/spark_tutorial/blob/master/spark_tutorial.py)

### Seperate the algorithm in to Steps
Furthermore,  I made a plan to separate the algorithm into several parts. The first part is to find out the itemset combinations and the second part is to calculate the utility.

In the first part, I will try to add features in to the Apriori to make it fit current input structure that contains an extra profit table of items.

### Next
I need to prepare the IEEExreme and ACM. I will pause the project until the next week.

#### Update in 10/16

I attended the IEEEXtreme 11.0 compitition with my friends as team DBSDXQ and get 638.38 points, we got the rank 382 in the world, rank 14 in Canada and rank 1 in the U of M.
