Today I setup this blog for the project report. The project is to implement the algorithm for the high-uility pattern mining. I will summary what I did for the mid September to today.

### Enviornment Setup
As the starting point, I establish the coding environment for scala and spark in windows and linux.

### Learn Scala
Furthermore, I went through sereval tutorials for scala from internet and tried coding with it with small programs to familiar with the language format. Here are the some links for the turtorials I referenced. In order to help myself to understand the language deeply, I also visit some websites in Chinese(my native language).

[A SCALA TUTORIAL FOR JAVA PROGRAMMERS (Scala official)](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html)

[面向 Java 开发人员的 Scala 指南系列 (IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-scala/)

### Try Apriori
To implement the Apriori algorithm is my first step of the project. Since the Apriori is the basics for the pattern mining. I already finished the implementation of a simple Apriori algorithm by scala.

### Next
The following days will be busy for me because there are some assignments from other courses is approaching to the deadline. The project will continue in the reading break.
