I am trying to implement my alg. in this month, but the process was not with out a hitch.

### A summarize of problems I found in Scala AND Spark
1. I found the usage of class and object sometimes will still makes me confuse.
2. The Spark has different running mode for cluster with or without hadoop, such as the cluster of the lab. Currently I am only using the local mode. And I am not familiar with map reduce.
3. The method I used to find the itemset combinations is inefficient. I want to have some references to the existing alg.s
4. The equations of calculate the utility are complicated, I am trying to break them down.
5. Its still takes a lot of times to figure out the small problems I met during the typing code :<

### Next
1. Solve the problems above. :)
2. Redo and optimize the itemset combinations part.
3. At least using a simple equation to calculate the utility of itemsets.
